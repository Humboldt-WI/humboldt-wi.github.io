      <description>Authors: Samantha Sizemore and Raiber Alkurdi Introduction Practitioners from quantitative Social Sciences such as Economics, Sociology, Political Science, Epidemiology and Public Health have undoubtedly come across matching as a go-to technique for preprocessing observational data before treatment effect estimation; those on the machine learning side of the aisle, however, may be unfamiliar with the concept of matching. This blog post aims to provide a succinct primer for matching neophytes and, for those already familiar with this technique, an overview of how state-of-the-art machine learning can be incorporated into the matching process.</description>

      <description>Marketing Campaign Optimization 
Causal Inference in Profit Uplift Modeling Authors: Asmir Muminovic, Lukas Kolbe 
Motivation The global spending on advertising amounts to more than 540 billion US dollars for 2018 only, and the spending for 2019 is predicted to reach over 560 billion US dollars. The marketing spendings have continuously increased since 2010 [17], and this trend does not seem to brittle in the near future. Although marketing is such an integral part of most businesses, marketers often fail to maximize the profitability of their marketing efforts.</description>

Applied Predictive Analytics Seminar - Causal KNN Beyond estimating the overall effect of a treatment, the uplift, econometric and statistical literature have set their eyes on estimating the personal treatment effect for each individual. This blogpost highly relates to the paper of Hitsch &amp;amp; Misra (2018), where a novel, direct uplift modeling approach is introduced, called Causal KNN. The k-nearest neighbour algorithm provides an interesting opportunity for the estimation of treatment effects in small groups.</description>

Christopher Ketzler, Guillermo Morishige
  Abstract: The aim of this paper is to replicate and apply the approach provided by Chernozhukov et al. (2016) to get the causal estimand of interest: average treatment effect (ATE) $\ \eta_0 $ using Neyman orthogonality and cross-fitting. For observational data, we will estimate the causal relationship between the eligibility and participation in the 401(k) and its effect on net financial assets; as well to apply it to other datasets, to find the effect of the Pennsylvania Reemployment Bonus on the unemployment duration and the effect of smoking on medical costs.</description>

  Introduction  The problem of credit scoring is a very standard one in Machine Learning literature and applications. Predicting whether or not a loan applicant will go default is one of the typical examples of classification problem, and usually serves as a good ground for application and comparison of various machine learning techniques- which, over the years, became very precise in making a binary prediction.</description>

      <description>Authors: Jakub Kondek, Karim Chennoufi, Kevin Noessler Introduction Motivation The increasing popularity of websites such as Instagram, Facebook or Youtube has lead to an increase in visual data over the last few years. These websites have become part of everyday life for many people and are therefore used excessively. The use of such websites has contributed among other things to enormously increasing amount of visual data in the process. Every day thousands of images and videos are uploaded, making it virtually impossible to analyze them by hand, as the sheer mass of content does not allow it.</description>

      <description>Authors: Gabriel Blumenstock, Yu Fan, Yang Tian Introduction What are generative models? In machine learning, generative models are used to generate new samples following the same distribution of the original data using unsupervised learning algorithms. Such methods provide a powerful way to detect and analyze enormous information of data, which has been applied to various domains, e.g. images and texts. By learning the statistical latent space of images or stories, the models are able to obtain human experiences and then “create” similar meaningful outputs.</description>

      <description>Authors: Christopher Ketzler, Stefan Grosse, Raiber Alkurdi Motivation The development of machine learning or deep learning (ML/DL) models which provides the user to have a decision to a specific problem has progressed enormously in the last years. The emergence of better computer hardware and therefore software, and the collecting of big data leads to more and more complicated algorithms. If these algorithms are no more understandable by average humans in terms of what are they doing or why they give a certain decision, we call them black-boxes.</description>

      <description>Financial Time Series Predicting with Long Short-Term Memory Authors: Daniel Binsfeld, David Alexander Fradin, Malte Leuschner Introduction Failing to forecast the weather can get us wet in the rain, failing to predict stock prices can cause a loss of money and so can an incorrect prediction of a patient’s medical condition lead to health impairments or to decease. However, relying on multiple information sources, using powerful machines and complex algorithms brought us to a point where the prediction error is as little as it has ever been before.</description>

      <description>Recommendation Systems Authors: Jingyi Liu, Brijesh Nanavati, Bharathi Srinivasan 
Introduction The explosion of information with the advent of the Internet and the multitude of choices available to customers introduces complexity in a customer’s decision processes. Recommender system is a useful information-filtering tool, which guides customers to a narrower selection of products and consequently helps them make better decisions. Matching users to the right products saves customers time and effort leading to increased user satisfaction, which in turn earns customer loyalty.</description>

      <description>Neural Networks into Production Authors: Mahdi Bayat, Denis Augusto Pinto Maciel, Roman Proskalovich Motivation Training and tuning machine learning model is a hard task. There are many variables involved that can make or break your results. However, also very important is, after fine tuning your model, to be able to deploy it, so it can be accessed by other researchers, developers and applications.
A very common way to accomplish that is by using an API.</description>

import numpy as np import pandas as pd 2+3  A Gentle Introduction to Neural Network Fundamentals 
Imagine the following problem: There are handwritten numbers that you want computer to correctly clasify. It would be an easy task for a person but an extremely complicated one for a machine, especially, if you want to use some traditional prediction model, like linear regression. Even though the computer is faster than the human brain in numeric computations, the brain far outperforms the computer in some tasks.</description>
