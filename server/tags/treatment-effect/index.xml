      <description>Double Machine Learning Implementation  
Christopher Ketzler, Guillermo Morishige
  Abstract: The aim of this paper is to replicate and apply the approach provided by Chernozhukov et al. (2016) to get the causal estimand of interest: average treatment effect (ATE) $\ \eta_0 $ using Neyman orthogonality and cross-fitting. For observational data, we will estimate the causal relationship between the eligibility and participation in the 401(k) and its effect on net financial assets; as well to apply it to other datasets, to find the effect of the Pennsylvania Reemployment Bonus on the unemployment duration and the effect of smoking on medical costs.</description>
