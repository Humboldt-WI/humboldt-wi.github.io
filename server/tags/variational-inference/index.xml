  Introduction  The problem of credit scoring is a very standard one in Machine Learning literature and applications. Predicting whether or not a loan applicant will go default is one of the typical examples of classification problem, and usually serves as a good ground for application and comparison of various machine learning techniques- which, over the years, became very precise in making a binary prediction.</description>
