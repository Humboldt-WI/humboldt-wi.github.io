      <description>Authors: Jakub Kondek, Karim Chennoufi, Kevin Noessler Introduction Motivation The increasing popularity of websites such as Instagram, Facebook or Youtube has lead to an increase in visual data over the last few years. These websites have become part of everyday life for many people and are therefore used excessively. The use of such websites has contributed among other things to enormously increasing amount of visual data in the process. Every day thousands of images and videos are uploaded, making it virtually impossible to analyze them by hand, as the sheer mass of content does not allow it.</description>

      <description>Financial Time Series Predicting with Long Short-Term Memory Authors: Daniel Binsfeld, David Alexander Fradin, Malte Leuschner Introduction Failing to forecast the weather can get us wet in the rain, failing to predict stock prices can cause a loss of money and so can an incorrect prediction of a patient’s medical condition lead to health impairments or to decease. However, relying on multiple information sources, using powerful machines and complex algorithms brought us to a point where the prediction error is as little as it has ever been before.</description>

      <description>Image Analysis: Introduction to deep learning for computer vision Authors: Nargiz Bakhshaliyeva, Severin Hußmann, Robert Kittel In this blog, we present the practical use of deep learning in computer vision. You will see how Convolutional Neural Networks are being applied to process the visual data, generating some valuable knowledge. In particular, we focused on the object recognition task, aiming to classify what kind of an object (a dog or a cat) is presented within a particular image by using the notion of Transfer Learning.</description>

      <description>Numeric representation of text documents: doc2vec how it works and how you implement it Authors: Felix Idelberger, Alisa Kolesnikova, Jonathan Mühlenpfordt Introduction Natural language processing (NLP) received a lot of attention from academia and industry over the recent decade, benefiting from the introduction of new algorithms for processing the vast corpora of digitized text. A set of language modeling and feature learning techniques called word embeddings became increasingly popular for NLP tasks.</description>

      <description>Recommendation Systems Authors: Jingyi Liu, Brijesh Nanavati, Bharathi Srinivasan 
Introduction The explosion of information with the advent of the Internet and the multitude of choices available to customers introduces complexity in a customer’s decision processes. Recommender system is a useful information-filtering tool, which guides customers to a narrower selection of products and consequently helps them make better decisions. Matching users to the right products saves customers time and effort leading to increased user satisfaction, which in turn earns customer loyalty.</description>

      <description>The Website of the Institute of Information Systems is based on a framework called Hugo. Hugo is a static website generator, which allows us to easily present your content of your deep learning projects. In order to present results in the best way, we combine this tool with another tool called Gist. Within this documentation you will learn how to work with those tools. The manual is composed of following sections:</description>

      <description>Image Captioning Authors: Benjamin Jaidi, Simon Remy, Murat Gökhan Yigit Introduction Image captioning aims for automatically generating a text that describes the present picture. In the last years it became a topic with growing interest in machine learning and the advances in this field lead to models that (depending on which evaluation) can score even higher than humans do. Image captioning can for instance help visually impaired people to grasp what is happening in a picture.</description>

      <description>Neural Networks into Production Authors: Mahdi Bayat, Denis Augusto Pinto Maciel, Roman Proskalovich Motivation Training and tuning machine learning model is a hard task. There are many variables involved that can make or break your results. However, also very important is, after fine tuning your model, to be able to deploy it, so it can be accessed by other researchers, developers and applications.
A very common way to accomplish that is by using an API.</description>

import numpy as np import pandas as pd 2+3  A Gentle Introduction to Neural Network Fundamentals 
Imagine the following problem: There are handwritten numbers that you want computer to correctly clasify. It would be an easy task for a person but an extremely complicated one for a machine, especially, if you want to use some traditional prediction model, like linear regression. Even though the computer is faster than the human brain in numeric computations, the brain far outperforms the computer in some tasks.</description>
